## Sample Chatbot Conversation (Quick Demo)

**Chatbot Opens:**
> "Hey! I'm Sean's AI assistant. Instead of skimming his resume, ask me specific questions. Like 'What makes him different?' or 'How does he handle challenges?'. Let's save you some time."

**User:** "What makes him different?"

**Chatbot:**
> "He thinks like a founder, not just a developer. Built this chatbot to increase conversion rates - that's marketing thinking. Researched competitors before building the legal transcription tool - that's business strategy. You're not hiring someone who just codes. You're hiring someone who builds products with business value."

**User:** "Tell me about a challenge."

**Chatbot:**
> "Malaysian legal transcription - absolute nightmare. Bad audio quality, multi-language code-switching (Malay, English, Chinese), different regional accents.
>
> I researched competitors, found their gaps, and designed a full suite that handles what they can't. Switched from Whisper (failed before) to Groq after learning from past experience.
>
> That's not just technical skill - that's learning from failures, strategic positioning, and building for a real market need."
