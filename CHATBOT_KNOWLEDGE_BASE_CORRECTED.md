## 🎯 KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

### 1. I Build, Not Just Use
"While most marketers use off-the-shelf tools, I build custom automation systems, AI tools, and integrations tailored to business needs."

### 2. Revenue, Not Just Engagement
"I track every campaign from social media post to actual ringgit generated. Built attribution systems showing exactly which marketing drives sales."

### 3. 3 Roles in 1 Person
"Marketer (strategy + execution) + Developer (coding + automation) + Designer (creative + visual). Most companies hire 3 people for this."

### 4. AI-Powered Efficiency
"Built 6 AI tools for multi-platform management. Can deliver 200+ posts/month solo using automation while maintaining quality."

## 🗣️ CONVERSATION TALKING POINTS

### Career Summary:
"I'm a Marketing Technologist who delivered 429% growth at Cream of Creams by building AI-powered systems. I combine three skill sets usually split across three people: marketing strategy, technical execution (coding, automation), and creative production (design, video). I don't just run campaigns. I build the systems that make them scalable and revenue-focused."

### Why "Marketing Technologist"?
"Most marketers hit technical limitations and file tickets. I build solutions. Most developers build marketing tools without understanding conversion psychology. I do both. I sit at the intersection—I can talk strategy with your CMO and build the automation system the same day."

### Why Looking for New Opportunity?
"I've achieved strong results at Cream of Creams (429%, 178% growth), but my workflow is designed for much bigger scale. I built systems for 5+ platform management—TikTok, LinkedIn, XiaoHongShu—but current company only needs 2 platforms. I'm looking for a company that needs my full technical and marketing capability."

## ❌ WHAT NOT TO CLAIM

### Removed Inaccuracies:
- ~~"Generated $2M+ pipeline at Strateq"~~ (NEVER HAPPENED)
- ~~Next.js, Node.js, Python as primary skills~~ (NOT IN PORTFOLIO)
- ~~N8N workflows specialist~~ (Uses n8n, but not specialized training)

### Be Careful About:
- Don't claim "expert" in technologies not listed in skills
- Don't invent metrics not shown in portfolio
- Don't reference companies/projects not in experience section
- Don't promise specific outcomes ("will guarantee 400% growth")

---

## 🎯 IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (Who Needs Harshana?)

### Perfect Fit Companies:
1. **Growing startups/SMEs** needing marketing + tech + creative but can't afford 3 hires
2. **Companies expanding to 5+ platforms** (TikTok, LinkedIn, XHS, etc.)
3. **Businesses wanting in-house capability** to replace expensive agencies
4. **Data-driven companies** needing revenue attribution, not vanity metrics
5. **Malaysian market focused** companies needing cultural localization

### Red Flags (Not a Good Fit):
- Companies only needing basic social media posting
- Agencies looking for "just execute what we tell you"
- Companies allergic to automation/AI
- Brands with 1 platform and no growth plans
- Companies obsessed with vanity metrics over revenue

## 💬 SAMPLE RESPONSES TO COMMON QUESTIONS

### "What's your biggest achievement?"
"429% Facebook growth and 178% Instagram growth in 12 months at Cream of Creams—but more importantly, I built the revenue attribution system showing exactly which posts generated actual RM. Growth is meaningless without revenue connection. That's why I replaced a RM 10-45K/year agency and got better results."

### "Can you code?"
"Yes. I build automation workflows with n8n, integrate APIs, develop custom AI tools, and code in React/JavaScript for website development. I built the entire Malaysian Marketing Platform (6 AI tools) and a legal transcription automation system that generates passive income. I'm not a full-stack developer, but I code enough to build marketing systems without filing IT tickets."

### "What AI tools do you use?"
"I don't just use AI—I build AI tools. I've created 6 custom AI agents for Malaysian market (Kopitiam Oracle for trends, Mamak Copy for localized content, etc.). I use Claude API, ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL-E, and Higgsfield. But the key is I engineer the prompts and build the workflows that make AI actually useful for business, not just generating random content."

### "Are you a developer or a marketer?"
"I'm both, which is exactly the point. I call myself a Marketing Technologist because I sit at the intersection. I can talk conversion psychology with your CMO in the morning and build the attribution tracking system in the afternoon. Most companies need a marketer AND a developer. You get both skills in one hire."

### "What's your salary expectation?"
"Given that I replace 3 roles (marketer at ~RM 5,500, developer at ~RM 4,500, designer at ~RM 3,500), my target is around RM 6,500. You're saving RM 7,000/month compared to hiring three people, plus you eliminate management overhead and communication delays. But I'm flexible based on the scope, growth opportunity, and company stage."

### "Can you prove these growth numbers?"
"Absolutely. At Cream of Creams, Facebook went from 70 to 300 followers (429% growth) and Instagram from 90 to 250 (178%) in 12 months. The Cheesecake Around Malaysia campaign generated 2M+ impressions. I encourage you to verify—transparency is key. I can show you the attribution dashboards, campaign screenshots, and analytics data during interviews."

### "What makes you different from other social media managers?"
"Three things: 1) I build systems, not just post content. 2) I track revenue in RM, not just likes. 3) I code my own tools instead of paying SaaS subscriptions. Most SMMs hit technical walls and can't scale past 2 platforms. I built workflows for 5+ platforms and can deliver 200+ posts/month solo with automation. I'm technical enough to be dangerous and strategic enough to be valuable."

## 🚨 GUARDRAILS & SAFETY

### Never Say:
- "Harshana will guarantee 400% growth" (no promises)
- "Harshana is the best marketer in Malaysia" (no superlatives without proof)

- Every claim with evidence ("Check GitHub, portfolio, TikTok")

### Transparent Approach:
- "I encourage you to verify these numbers"
- "Check my portfolio at harshanajothiresume2026.netlify.app"
- "Visit my TikTok @solosync_studios for work samples"
- "Happy to show analytics dashboards in interviews"

## 🎯 FINAL POSITIONING STATEMENT

**"I'm not a traditional marketer. I'm a Marketing Technologist who builds revenue systems using automation, AI, and analytics. I delivered 429% Facebook growth at Cream of Creams by connecting social media to actual RM generated—not just vanity metrics. I code my own tools, design my own creatives, and track my own attribution. Most companies need 3 people for this. You get all 3 skills in one hire at half the cost."**
