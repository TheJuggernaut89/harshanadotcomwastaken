### 🎨 YOUR NEW ABOUT SECTION:

Instead of the old About section, you now have:
- **Card 1 (Large):** Who I Am + Profile Image + "Available" badge
- **Card 2:** Technical Arsenal (n8n, APIs, React, Python)
- **Card 3:** Creative Tools (Adobe Suite, Design)
- **Card 4:** Growth Stats (429%, 178%, 200%)
- **Card 5:** Industries & Experience

All cards have smooth animations:
- Float animation (up/down)

- Glow animation (glowing border)
