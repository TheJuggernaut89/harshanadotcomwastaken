--- Older Message 1 ---
https://github.com/lanretuase/Legal_transcribe_bot

analyze this site and tell me if this can be used to create a Malaysian legal transcription automation that analyzes multiple languages in a single court hearing with Malay and English code switch mix and bad audio quality for some hearings

--- Older Message 2 ---
Problems: 
1) Audio file bad quality
2) Accents accross Malaysia is different in North and South
3) Multiple language code-switching  between Malay, English and sometimes chinese
4) It has to be verbatim transcription. Transcribe what has been said regardless of language (no translation) 
5) Malaysian Language terminology
6) Malaysian legal terminology

I want to create a software that is called Malaysian Legal Transcription - I want it to be a full suite

What is does
1) Gets uploaded file
2) Understands and reads through the bundle of documents via Pdf file
3) Understands the information present
4) Breaks down large file to transcribe
5) Transcribes - verbatim transcription
6) Reformats the transcription text into a document FILE - Docx
7) Send it to the proofreader email automatically

What modifications are needed? What is front end recommended design and  backend design 

Use @frontent-design as reference

Create full PRD when done for review

Do not implement anything, lets discu

Questions for 

1) NO
2) Link based
3) API
4) payper use for now, the next 3 months
5) Required
6) Required


PRD
1) Improve it, to see if anything esle could be added in but preserving the same vision or concept, easy to start and minimal cost
2) Groq API sounds good
3) - 
4) Make a shorter timeline - I have 8 hours per day
5) Acceptable, very much
6) Yes

Review competitions in Malaysia that are doing this and analyze the gaps in them. Once done, list them our and see what Opportunities we have against them. 

--- Older Message 4 ---
I have tried using Whisper in the past, it always fails to transcribe after a long period of time. Groq vs Open Ai Whisper, which is better in performance and quality and speed

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze this comprehensive conversation chronologically to create a thorough summary:

**Conversation Flow:**
1. User asked me to analyze a GitHub repository for Malaysian legal transcription
2. I determined it wouldn't work and user provided detailed requirements
3. I created 3 comprehensive planning documents (PRD, Competitive Analysis, Executive Summary)
4. User confirmed multiple preferences and approved the PRD
5. I created detailed setup guides for Weeks 0, 1, and 2
6. User confirmed "yes" to continue
7. I created Week 3 Days 1-2 setup guide
8. User confirmed "yes" to continue with Days 3-5

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Tech Stack: React + Vite frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL (Neon), Redis (Upstash)
- AI: Groq Whisper Large v3 (primary), Replicate (fallback), OpenAI (emergency)
- Infrastructure: Railway (

This software would be made using Antigravity. Is that a better alternative than Claude Code? Claudde COde is the architect and Antigravity is the construction worker

then verify with claude mcp list
