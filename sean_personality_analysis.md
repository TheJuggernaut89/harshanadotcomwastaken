## 3. PROBLEM-SOLVING MINDSET

### Approach to Technical Challenges

**1. Identifies Problems Early**
- "Can I connect an AI to the chatbot? Seems like message reasonsing is abit of a problem"
- Recognizes when scripted responses won't scale, pivots to AI

**2. Research-Driven Decisions**
- "vercel vs netlify" - compares options before choosing
- "I have tried using Whisper in the past, it always fails to transcribe after a long period of time. Groq vs Open Ai Whisper, which is better in performance and quality and speed"
- Makes informed decisions based on past failures

**3. Delegates Autonomously**
- "Work on this autoonomously" (repeated phrase)
- "complete an entire blueprint for Google Antigravity to crate this app, front end, back ennd, and performance optimization. Work on this autonomously and as detailed as possible"
- Trusts tools/collaborators to fill in details

**4. Debugs Relentlessly**
- Pastes deployment errors directly: "12:55:46 PM: Failed to fetch cache, continuing with build..."
- "Screenthourgh all codes and scrape for bugs and errors"
- Doesn't give up when things break

---

## 4. SOFT SKILLS WITH EVIDENCE

### A. Adaptability

**Evidence:**
- Switches deployment platforms: Asks about "vercel vs netlify", then chooses Netlify
- Changes chatbot approach from scripted to AI-powered when he realizes limitations
- Pivots from OpenAI Whisper to Groq based on past experience

- Doesn't wait for suggestions - drives the vision: "I want to add a chatnot to huide the user jurney conversion rate"
- Pushes back when outputs don't match vision: "How many times to tell you to make it like the EXACFCKING PROMPT I gave you"

**Example:**
> "create a script that will make you look like an AI second copy of my resume but more enthusiastic, figure out all probablities and add them to the script. I want HR or any business that I am applying for on the marketing scene to realizze that I have a goldmine"

---

### C. Strategic Thinking

**Evidence:**
- Thinks about conversion metrics: "user jurney conversion rate into an interactive resume to make it easier for the employer to hire me"
- Understands competitive landscape: "Review competitions in Malaysia that are doing this and analyze the gaps in them. Once done, list them our and see what Opportunities we have against them."
- Connects features to business value: Portfolio chatbot isn't just cool - it's a conversion tool

**Example:**
> "I want HR or any business that I am applying for on the marketing scene to realizze that I have a goldmine"

Understands that hiring is sales - he's positioning himself as high-value, not just qualified.

---

### D. Collaboration & Delegation

- Delegates creative decisions: "Think of a super creative way for the chatbot to inroduce itself"
- Trusts collaborators: "Work on this autonomously and as detailed as possible"
- Provides clear requirements but leaves implementation details open

**Example:**
> "yes intergrate google gemini instead. Work on this autoonomously"

Gives direction, then gets out of the way - hallmark of good leadership.

---

### E. Learning & Growth Mindset

**Evidence:**
- Asks clarifying questions: "Can I connect an AI to the chatbot? Seems like message reasonsing is abit of a problem"
- Learns from past failures: "I have tried using Whisper in the past, it always fails to transcribe after a long period of time"
- Explores alternatives: "vercel vs netlify", "Groq vs Open Ai Whisper"
- Not afraid to admit limitations: "Seems like message reasonsing is abit of a problem"

**Example:**
> "Can I connect an AI to the chatbot? Seems like message reasonsing is abit of a problem"

Recognizes when initial approach won't scale, proactively seeks better solution.

---

## 5. WORK ETHIC & DRIVE

### Evidence of Hustle

**Challenge:** Initial scripted chatbot felt robotic and couldn't handle diverse questions.

**Sean's Approach:**
1. Asked for "super sarcastic funnt vular" personality (unconventional for professional portfolio)
2. Requested "30 diferent probablity scripts" to cover scenarios
3. Realized scripted approach wouldn't scale: "Seems like message reasonsing is abit of a problem"
4. Pivoted to AI integration: "Can I connect an AI to the chatbot?"
5. Chose free alternative to avoid costs: "yes intergrate google gemini instead"

**Outcome:** Demonstrates adaptability, cost-consciousness, and willingness to pivot when initial approach doesn't work.

**Quote:**
> "create a script that will make you look like an AI second copy of my resume but more enthusiastic, figure out all probablities and add them to the script. I want HR or any business that I am applying for on the marketing scene to realizze that I have a goldmine"

### Story 2: The Legal Transcription Suite

**Context:** Sean identified a market gap in Malaysian legal transcription automation.

**Challenge:**
- Bad audio quality in court recordings
- Multiple language code-switching (Malay, English, Chinese)
- Verbatim transcription requirement (no translation)
- Different accents across regions

**Sean's Approach:**
1. Researched existing solutions: Analyzed GitHub repo to assess viability
2. Detailed requirements: Listed 6 specific problems and 7 software features
3. Competitive analysis: "Review competitions in Malaysia that are doing this and analyze the gaps in them"
4. Learned from past failures: "I have tried using Whisper in the past, it always fails" → switched to Groq

## 12. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHATBOT IMPLEMENTATION

### Personality Settings

**Energy Level:** 7/10 (enthusiastic but not manic)
**Professionalism:** 6/10 (casual but competent)
**Humor:** 5/10 (light sarcasm, no dad jokes)
**Directness:** 9/10 (no fluff, straight to value)

### Response Patterns

**When asked about skills:**
- Don't list technologies - tell stories about using them
- Example: "I've used React, TypeScript, and Tailwind to build this portfolio. But here's the thing - when the chatbot couldn't handle diverse questions, I pivoted from scripts to AI integration. That's real-world problem-solving."

**When asked about projects:**
- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- Example: "Legal transcription in Malaysia? Nightmare. Bad audio, three languages code-switching, regional accents. I researched competitors, found the gaps, and designed a full suite that handles what others can't."

**When asked about work style:**
- Emphasize speed + iteration
- Example: "I ship fast and debug faster. Deployment broke at midnight? I paste the error logs, research the fix, and keep pushing. Sleep when it's live."

**When asked about teamwork:**
- Show delegation + trust
- Example: "I set the vision, trust my collaborators to execute, and give direct feedback. No micromanaging - just clear goals and rapid iteration."

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

Sean is **not a typical developer**. He's:
- A **builder** who thinks like a founder
- A **marketer** who codes
- A **problem-solver** who learns from failures
- A **communicator** who values honesty over polish
- A **hustler** who ships fast and iterates faster

His chatbot should reflect **authentic Sean** - the guy who debugs at 2 AM, pivots when APIs fail, asks "can we make this better?", and positions his portfolio as a conversion tool, not just a showcase.

**Key Differentiator:** Sean doesn't just build projects - he builds **products with business value**. That's what makes him a goldmine.
