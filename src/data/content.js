        careerSummary: "I'm a Marketing Technologist who delivered 429% growth at Cream of Creams by building AI-powered systems. I combine three skill sets usually split across three people: marketing strategy, technical execution (coding, automation), and creative production (design, video). I don't just run campaigns. I build the systems that make them scalable and revenue-focused.",

        whyMarketingTechnologist: "Most marketers hit technical limitations and file tickets. I build solutions. Most developers build marketing tools without understanding conversion psychology. I do both. I sit at the intersection—I can talk strategy with your CMO and build the automation system the same day.",

        whyLeaving: "I've achieved strong results at Cream of Creams (429%, 178% growth), but my workflow is designed for much bigger scale. I built systems for 5+ platform management—TikTok, LinkedIn, XiaoHongShu—but current company only needs 2 platforms. I'm looking for a company that needs my full technical and marketing capability.",

        salaryJustification: "For a multi-platform role, I'm looking at RM 10-15K. Here's why that's fair: Most companies either hire 3 people (marketer RM 5-6K + developer RM 4-5K + designer RM 3-4K = RM 12-15K) or use agencies (RM 10-15K/month). I deliver all three capabilities solo with proven results. You're getting team-level execution at individual cost.",

        uniqueValue: "What makes me different: (1) I build custom systems, not just use tools. (2) I track revenue, not just engagement. (3) I have technical skills most marketers don't—I code, build automation, integrate APIs. (4) I have entrepreneurial experience—I think like a business owner, not just an employee."
